    <p class="wow">LANGLY, VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's office of the Inpector General reled that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence with black highlighters.</p>

   <p> According to the report, sections of the documents-"almost invariably the most crucial passages"-are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947</p>

   <p>CIA Director Poter Goss Lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events,such as.</p>

   <ul>
       <li>the Cold War</li>
       <li>the civil-rights movment</li>
       <li>the growth of the inernational drug trade</li>
